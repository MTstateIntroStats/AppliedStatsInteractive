# MAT 240 and MAT 241 Interactive Notes Installation and Access Guide

I've written a series of interactive workbooks which will serve as your notes for MAT 240 and MAT 241. This guide provides instructions for how to access those notes. You will perform 3 or 4 steps depending on your operating system. The steps are listed below, but detailed instructions follow for both Windows and MACOS systems.

1. **Install R:** R is a computing language which has been optimized for use in statistics, data analytics, and data science.
2. **Install RStudio:** RStudio is a convenient way to interface with the R language. Think of R as "Spanish" and RStudio as Microsoft Word -- you can write R in RStudio, just like you can write Spanish text in Microsoft Word.
3. Install the packages necessary to access the notes.

## Installing R

Installing R is quite simple. Navigate to [CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and choose the link corresponding to your operating system. Follow the instructions below corresponding to your operating system below. 

**Windows:** 

+ Click the link titled **<span style = "color:blue">Install R for the first time</span>**.
+ Once the download completes, run the installer -- keep all of the default options.
+ Once R has finished installing you'll need to download `Rtools40`. Click [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/) and choose the 64-bit installer.
+ Once the installer has downloaded, run the installer -- again keep all of the default options.
+ Once you've done this, restart your computer.

**MACOS:**

+ After clicking the link for the Mac OS X operating system, look for the link titled <span style = "color:blue">R-4.0.2.pkg</span>. Click this link and follow the installation instractions. Keep all of the defaults set.

## Installing RStudio

+ To install RStudio, click [this link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
+ Under the *Choose Your Version* heading, you'll click the Download button underneath the *Free Desktop Version*.
+ RStudio.com will automatically detect your operating system. Click the download link presented to you. It is a blue button underneath step "2." -- you've already done step "1.".
+ Once the download has finished, run the installer -- keep all of the default options.

## Getting the Notes Packages

Search your computer for the RStudio application you just installed, and open it. When you first open RStudio you should be presented with a window that has three panes -- the long pane on the left should be titled `Console`. This is a place for you to run R code.

+ Click into the console next to the prompt (`>`) and type the following command: `install.packages("devtools")`
+ You can hit the `Enter` or `Return` key on your keyboard to run the command. Red and black text will splash onto the `Console` while the required utilities are being installed. What for the install to finish -- you'll be presented with a message in the console that the install has finished and your prompt (`>`) will return.
+ After `devtools` has been installed, run the following command `remotes::install_github("agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive")`
  
  + After you hit `Enter` or `Return` and the command is run, you may be asked several times (three or four times) about updating existing packages. You can type 3 and hit `Enter` or `Return`, which is the option to update none of the existing packages.
  + In between refusing the package updates, more black and red text will splash to the console. You'll know that the install has completed when you get a message in the console stating so and your prompt (`>`) has returned. This should take between 3 and 8 minutes or so.
  
## Accessing the Notebooks

Now that you have `R`, `RStudio`, and the `AppliedStatsInteractive` package installed you won't need to work through those steps again. All you need to do each time you want to access our interactive notes is use the following steps:

+ Open `RStudio` -- make sure you open RStudio and not just plain R -- if you've only got a small window with a blinking cursor, that's R -- close it and reopen RStudio instead.
+ In the console, run the command `learnr::run_tutorial("NOTEBOOK_NAME", package = "AppliedStatsInteractive")`

  + You should replace `NOTEBOOK_NAME` in the command listed about with the name of the notebook you want to run. For example, `learnr::run_tutorial("0_StartHere", package = "AppliedStatsInteractive")` will open a notebook which just gives some information about the package. This is designed to help other instructors decide whether they want to use these tutorials in their courses. A list of notebook names appears below, and also in the *tentative course schedule* section of your syllabus. See if you can run the first tutorial workbook.
  
### Notebook Names

The following is a list of the names of our notebooks. You can also find these notebook names listed in the *tentative course schedule* of our syllabus, so you know which notebooks to be working through.

  + `1_IntroToData`
  + `2_IntroToR`
  + `3_DescriptiveNumCat`
  + `4_DataViz`
  + `5_DiscreteDistributions`
  + `6_NormalDistribution`
  + `7_DiscreteDistributionsLab`
  + `8_NormalDistributionLab`
  + `9_FoundationsForInference`
  + `10_IntroInferenceLab`
  + `11_HTandCIprop`
  + `12_InferencePractice`
  + `13_InferenceCategoricalLab`
  + `14_ChiSquare`
  + `15_HTandCInum`
  + `16_InferencePractice`
  + `17_InferenceNumericalLab`
  + `18_ANOVA`
  + `19_LinearRegression`

If you are in MAT240, you'll notice that your syllabus skips the notebooks labeled by `Lab` -- we will have different assignments in place of those. Please reach out to me with any questions you have. I'll help you troubleshoot the installation process.
